## There is Certain steps in order to Fabricate the PCB 
  -After finishing the Design on Eagle Software (Discussed before ) we have to check 
  
    *A complete engineering review for circuitry
    *Synchronized schematic and layout databases
    *Complete circuit simulation, signal integrity, and power integrity analysis
    *Checked PCB design rules and constraints
    *Bill of materials and design for manufacturing rules are reviewed
    
  -then we have to print the design on sitting paper 
  -We need heat in order to make sure the Traces to be printed on the board without any kind of short circuit or open circuit   
  -we can iron for this operation it should last for 15 minute to be sure that all the traces is printed correctly
  -The next is step is Oxidation 
  
  With all of the layers etched, a chemical treatment called oxide is applied to the inner layers of a printed circuit board to improve the strength of the     bond
  
  -Drilling
  
  In order for a printed circuit board to send signals from one layer to another, holes must be drilled or lasered in to form vias which connect them.         Drilling differs depending on the type of via being used, but generally is done on a stack of 2-3 panels at a time. The end result will generally be 5 mil   larger than the end product, as these holes will be plated with copper to help send electrical signals through a process called electroless copper           deposition.
  
  -Welding 
  
  is the method to place one or more electronic components on PCB using a solder. The solder melts and fixes the electronic components at their places. The     melting point of solder metal is smaller than that of parts and the PCB. Hence, PCB welding is also called PCB soldering.
  
  -After these steps , The PCB will be ready to be tested as Hardware
